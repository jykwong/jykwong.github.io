        <ul>
            <li>Personal Background: Chinese-American, born in North Carolina. Transfer student to UNC Charlotte.</li>
            <li>Professional: Family owned a restaurant for nearly 30 years. I began working at the family business at age 15. Over time, I learned a variety of positions and ended up making sushi there for several years. I also worked at a Amazon warehouse for a short time.</li>
            <li>Academic Background: Highschool graduate, received an Associates Degree from community college, transfer student to UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science.</li>
            <li>Background in the subject matter of this course: I've been into computers since I was a kid, and I knew I wanted to work with computers professionally. I decided to go back to school so I could make that a reality.</li>
            <li>Primary Computer Platform: Windows 10 on both a desktop (I built one myself) and my laptop</li>
            <li>Courses I'm taking and reason for each:
                <ul>
                    <li>ITIS 3135 Web App Design and Development - Tech elective I was interested in</li>
                    <li>ITIS 3200 Intro to Info Security & Priv - Tech elective I was interested in</li>
                    <li>ITSC 2175 Logic and Algorithms - Required for major</li>
                    <li>STAT 2223 Elements of Statistics II - Required for major</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Funny story or interesting thing about myself: 
                McGriddles are my favorite food group. I also enjoy photography and gaming.
            </li>
            <li>I'd also like to share: 
                I can type at 120 words per minute. It's stressful trying to keep that pace, but I type comfortably at 90-100 wpm.
            </li>

        </ul>
