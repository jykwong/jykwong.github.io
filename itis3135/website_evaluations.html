            <!--assessment of the site's following/not following of those principles-->
            <p>
                Craigslist uses an extremely simple, yet functional design. The website has not had any design changes made to its homepage, giving it the appearance of a late 1990's or early 2000s design. When browsing ads, the user can change the appearance of the advertisements to utilize images to appear more modern. Craigslist follows most of the CRAP principles, but the outdated design makes the site look old and ugly. The homepage is littered with hyperlinks which will make the website unappealing to new users.
